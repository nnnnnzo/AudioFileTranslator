# AudioFileTranslator
AFT is a python script based on the googletrans and speech_recognition modules. The script transcribe and translate an audio file to another language. The script is easy to understand and edit, the out of the box version translate a French dialogue to an English text.

* AFT.py work by installing the two required python modules:
</br>`$ pip install googletrans`
</br>`$ pip install SpeechRecognition`

PS: The audio used in the screenshot is not really appropriate, it is made to learn the pronunciation of French words; hence the errors towards the end of the translation.
